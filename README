maintain each tab different working directory,
and switch directory automatically when switch tab,
and can also do custom actions when switch tab,like
auto reload tags in the new directory, and some other plugin 
would also benefit from this plugin,like CommandT, grep, working in a 
sub directory is so mush fast and easy
